               <h3><b>Daikaku-ji Temple</b></h3>
               <p>Daikaku-ji was once the imperial palace of the Emperor Saga, and has since been converted into a large temple, whose grounds include the elegant Shinden Hall, or emperor’s residence, which was moved and reconstructed from the Kyoto Imperial Palace, and Osawa Pond, a nationally-designated site of natural beauty with beautiful cherry blossoms.</p>

               <h3><b>Jojakko-ji Temple</b></h3>
               <p>Jojakko-ji Temple’s temple grounds are buried in the beautiful maple leaves that cover the side of Mt. Ogura, and the top of its two-storied pagoda offers a panoramic view of Kyoto City. Whether you’re looking for the vibrant reds of autumn, or the fresh, bright green of spring and summer, you’re sure to find this temple beautiful.</p>

               <h3><b>Gio-ji Temple</b></h3>
               <p>Arashiyama’s legendary bamboo is still visible from Gio-ji Temple, but it’s when the sunlight shines through the trees in the temple ground and on to the mossy carpet below that the temple truly becomes magical. This incredibly green location is a wonderful natural escape.</p>
